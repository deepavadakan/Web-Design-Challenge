### Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

Create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations created from weather data assignment.

Create individual pages for each plot and a means to navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. Pages include a landing page, a page where to see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page to view the data used to build them.

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

1. A landing page containing:
    * An explanation of the project.
    * Links to each visualizations page. A sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image  takes the user to that visualization.
    
    (https://deepavadakan.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/)
    
    
2. Four visualization pages (Max Temparature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed), each with:
    * A descriptive title and heading tag.
    * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
    * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

3. A "Comparisons" page that:  
    Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
    
    (https://deepavadakan.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/WebVisualizations/visualizations/comparison.html)
    
    
4. A "Data" page that:  
    Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    
    (https://deepavadakan.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/WebVisualizations/visualizations/data.html)

The grid has two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
